# What is Ticketh?
Ticketh is a decentralized event ticket marketplace built on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Utilizing its own ERC20 token 'ticketh' (symbol: TKT) ticketh aims at providing event attendees fair pricing for both retail and resale tickets, without the ridiculous fees charged by more traditional ticket sellers, all while eliminating scalpers and increasing artist / performer/ event organizer revenue.
